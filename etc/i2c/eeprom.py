# Detect a 16-bit address device using only safe 8-bit address commands
#
# The issue here is that we don't know whether we have a 24c02 or a 24c64
# compatible device in the FMC EEPROM -- and these two devices have incompatible
# access methods.  In particular, the 24c64 needs a two byte read address to be
# written to it, whereas the 24c02 interprets a two byte write as writing a byte
# to the EEPROM.
#    The code below relies on undocumented behaviour that we are seeing on the
# M24C64: writing a single byte appears to reset the entire page address (32 bit
# transfer pages), but not the byte offset within the page.
#    Therefore the trick here is to read half of the same page twice using
# single byte addressing: if we get the same result both times then assume that
# this is ok, otherwise fall back to two byte addressing.
